# Unbroken Line Art Creator

Inspired by the images here http://imgur.com/gallery/r8zBl this tool is designed to create unbroken line art.

For more information checkout my post at https://declanrussell.com/portfolio/unbroken-line-portraits/

In the current state you will have to change the image by setting it in the initialize function in NGLScene. Maybe ill get around to making a better interface if there is a demand for it.
Spacebar - plays the animation
R - Resets animation
C - toggles color
